ChIJB1EHMbTz2YkRda7GCxfLHg8,5,I love this place. The food is great and it’s a simple ma and pa place. The pho is outstanding! ( if you’re really hungry you can get extra noodles for $1) I always get the spring rolls because they are super fresh. The raw beef w tumerum is excellent. We got the fish today ( see pic) and it was tasty
ChIJB1EHMbTz2YkRda7GCxfLHg8,5,"Wow, this is it! As a proud Vietnamese, I can confidently say that I have finally found the best Banh Mi spot around NY. The taste is simply out of this world, from the juicy meat to the freshly baked bread, everything just hits the spot perfectly! This is a must-try for anyone in the city, and I can't wait to come back for more! 100% recommended, you won't regret it!"
ChIJB1EHMbTz2YkRda7GCxfLHg8,5,"Best Banh Mi! This is my go to place for great tasting Vietnamese sandwich. Have tried ones from different places but nothing compares to this. Owners are very friendly, too! They have limited quantities daily, don’t miss out!"
ChIJq3w1Wn_x2YkR9HofEc9puio,5,"I got a bahn mi and beef pho and my wife got steamed dumplings and the coconut bowl. It all came to about $53, which I initially felt was a little on the pricey side. After having tasted everything, however, my reservations are completely gone -- this food is fresh and this food is DELICIOUS. The servers (take out) were all super nice and the meal as a whole was out of this world. We shall recommend and we shall definitely return!!!"
ChIJq3w1Wn_x2YkR9HofEc9puio,5,"One of my favorite places to go eat for lunch and dinner. The Pho is delicious, the fried dumplings are the best my wife and I have had. My boys love the fried rice entrees. Don't let the exterior appearance fool you, this is a place worth visiting frequently. I almost forgot the Ban Mi sandwiches, so good"
ChIJq3w1Wn_x2YkR9HofEc9puio,4,Authentic foods friend highly skilled chefs!! This is hands down the best Vietnamese food I've had and wish that I lived in NY to eat there more. The Pho had excellent flavors as did the noodle dishes we tried.
ChIJq3w1Wn_x2YkR9HofEc9puio,3,"I want to caveat this review by saying that the restaurant is family run and understaffed. This was my first time patronizing this establishment and the only reason I did was because someone told me that their pho was better than my usual pho place near downtown. The pho was good however, I don't think it was worth the drive"
ChIJXzHY70ny2YkRMytGWVnP-I0,3,Lots of parking at the back of the restaurant. Large facility looks a bit rundown. Food is ok. Sizes are small. Bring cash to avoid 3% additional charge on credit card payment.
ChIJXzHY70ny2YkRMytGWVnP-I0,5,The food was really great! The noodles were delicious. I personally think #21 is better than the classic #10 pho. The desserts were also great. I love the durian shake with actual durian pulp!

ChIJB1EHMbTz2YkRda7GCxfLHg8,5,Amazing food. The peanut bowl is to die for and they actually give you a serving size that makes sense (don't expect leftovers). Normally I hate going to the city for anything but parking is super easy here mid-day (and free if you're in the parking lot). Definitely worth it.
ChIJB1EHMbTz2YkRda7GCxfLHg8,4,"I tried the vegan banh mi and the vegan Pho noodle bowl. Both were definitely decent. But, I have had better vegan banh mi elsewhere (though not in Syracuse), and I wouldn't have gotten the noodle bowl had I known that it was served cold. The prices here are reasonable though and the lady at the counter was very nice. I have to give this place credit for having vegan options that are more than just an afterthought"
